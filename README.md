Image-Reference
===============

A useful tool to display reference images to a builder while they work.

Installation
===============
1. Put this entire folder into Steam/Steamapps/USERNAME/garrysmod/garrysmod/addons/
2. Done, enjoy building.

Usage
===============

To use this tool, bind a key to 'imgref_menu'. This can be done by typing in your console 'bind <key> imgref_menu'.

Press the button while ingame, and copy-paste a internet link to a picture inside the box. The box may be moved and even resized before you press enter to load the image.

Once the image is loaded, controls are returned to the user so you can build again. To move the box (resizing is unavailable after image load), simply hold c and you can.

To exit the image reference box, either hold c and press the 'X' on the box or press the binded key again.
